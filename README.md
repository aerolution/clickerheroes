# This is a project I'm "working" on.
I found a chrome extension that supposedly unblocks this game, however, you can't use Ruffle (flash emulator chrome extension) on "private" pages. So, I imported the extension into github, to see if it'll work!



 Link to the original chrome extension: (i found it on a shady website lol)
